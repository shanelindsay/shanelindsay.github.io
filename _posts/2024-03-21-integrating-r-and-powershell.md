Integrating R and PowerShell can significantly enhance automation, data processing, and system-level operations. This guide outlines four key approaches, providing practical examples and highlighting their strengths and limitations for different workflows.

## 1. HTTP Server Approach (Recommended)

### Overview

Utilising R's **httpuv** package, this approach creates a lightweight HTTP server to handle requests from PowerShell via plain text. It balances simplicity and functionality, making it ideal for both interactive sessions and automated tasks.

### Implementation

- **Server-side:** Run an R server script (`r_server.R`) to maintain a persistent session.
- **Client-side:** Execute commands in PowerShell using `Invoke-WebRequest`.

#### Interactive Development Mode

Start the server within R or RStudio:

```r
# In R console or RStudio
source("Analyses/R-PowerShell-Integration/approaches/persistent_http/r_server.R")
x <- 42  # Variable accessible from both R and PowerShell
```

#### Automated Service Mode

Run the server in the background via PowerShell:

```powershell
# In PowerShell
Rscript Analyses/R-PowerShell-Integration/approaches/persistent_http/r_server.R
```

Send commands from PowerShell:

```powershell
# Load the client function
. .\Analyses\R-PowerShell-Integration\approaches\persistent_http\r_client.ps1

# Execute R commands
.\r_client.ps1 "x <- 42"
.\r_client.ps1 "x * 2"
.\r_client.ps1 "summary(iris)"
```

### Advantages

- Maintains a persistent R session
- Supports interactive and automated modes
- Simple with minimal dependencies
- Facilitates debugging and remote access if needed

### Limitations

- Basic text-based communication
- Manual server lifecycle management
- Single R session per server instance

**Security Tip:** Consider securing the HTTP server if exposed externally (e.g., using IP whitelisting or authentication mechanisms).

## 2. Plumber API Approach (Full-Featured)

### Overview

Using R's **plumber** package, this method sets up a REST API server for structured HTTP/JSON communication. It supports self-documenting endpoints and robust error handling, suitable for production environments.

### Implementation

- **Server-side:** Run a Plumber server with defined endpoints (e.g., `plumber.R`).
- **Client-side:** Use PowerShell's `Invoke-RestMethod` to interact with the API.

#### Example Plumber Endpoint

```r
library(plumber)

# plumber.R
#' @get /add
#' @param x First number
#' @param y Second number
function(x, y) as.numeric(x) + as.numeric(y)

pr("plumber.R") %>% run(port = 8000)
```

### Advantages

- Structured JSON data exchange with error handling
- Automatic API documentation
- Supports complex data types and team collaboration

### Limitations

- Requires additional setup for API endpoints
- More complex than basic HTTP for simple tasks

**Security Tip:** Use API keys or tokens for secure communication in production.

## 3. Rserve Approach (Performance-Oriented)

### Overview

The **Rserve** package sets up a server that communicates via a binary protocol, optimised for performance and large data transfersâ€”ideal for computation-heavy tasks.

### Implementation

- **Server-side:** Launch an Rserve server using:

```r
library(Rserve)
Rserve(args = "--no-save")
```

- **Client-side:** Use a PowerShell TCP client to connect.

### Advantages

- Efficient binary protocol for large datasets
- High performance with native R data type handling

### Limitations

- Complex setup and potential version compatibility issues
- Less intuitive debugging compared to HTTP-based methods

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Check for port conflicts and firewall settings if connection issues arise.

## 4. Direct Shell Commands (Basic)

### Overview

This method relies on command-line interactions, executing R commands via `system()` and `Rscript`. It's simple and requires no additional dependencies.

### Implementation

- **R:** Call PowerShell commands:

```r
system('powershell -Command "Get-Process"')
```

- **PowerShell:** Execute R scripts:

```powershell
Rscript -e "summary(mtcars)"
```

### Advantages

- Simplest implementation
- Ideal for one-off scripts or basic automation
- No extra packages required

### Limitations

- No session persistence (each command spawns a new R process)
- Limited data exchange and higher performance overhead
- Basic error handling compared to other methods

## Session Sharing Capabilities

| Approach          | Session Persistence | Data Exchange | Complexity | Best For                           |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| HTTP Server       | Yes                 | Text-based    | Moderate   | General automation, debugging      |
| Plumber API       | No (Stateless)      | JSON          | High       | Production APIs, structured data   |
| Rserve            | Yes                 | Binary        | High       | High-performance computations      |
| Direct Shell Cmds | No                  | Limited       | Low        | Simple scripts, one-off tasks      |

## Final Thoughts

Choosing the right integration method depends on your workflow requirements:

- **HTTP Server:** Practical for interactive and automated tasks.
- **Plumber API:** Best for production environments needing structured data exchange.
- **Rserve:** Ideal for performance-critical, data-intensive computations.
- **Direct Shell Commands:** Suitable for simple or isolated automation tasks.
