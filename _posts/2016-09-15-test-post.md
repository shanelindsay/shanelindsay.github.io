This website is hosted using github pages using Jekyll. 

It is based on a very basic theme from http://thomasleeper.com/software.html

Github pages gives you a free account with a built in management system to create static webpages. It relies on markdown for writing posts, and Jekyll also provides a simple blogging engine. At some point I will get a custom URL but for now I am linking to this site from my University profile which should be come up high in google searches as google tends to uprank University sites.
