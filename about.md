I was born in Fiji. I have never been back, yet. 

I grew up in a village called Cottenham, outside of Cambridge. After which I lived in Hatfield, St. Albans, Brighton, York, Dundee and Hull.

I have a wife, [whippet](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10155519003550461.1073741838.833460460&type=1&l=575527ce88), and a whippersnapper.  

Also, two cats.
