My research concerns the relationship of the language system with perception, action, sleep and memory. I have a specialisation in psycholinguistics and have conducted studies of language learning, sub-lexical processing, lexical processing and semantics, and discourse level processing. While psycholinguistics has been my focus, my work is interdisciplinary. Its goal has been to understand the embedding of the language system in its broader context of a brain specialised for the goals of perception and action, rather than seeing language as an isolated modular system. This research has used behavioural measures, eye tracking and cognitive neuroscience methods, including fMRI, TMS and polysomnography.
