# Research Background

I am passionate about understanding how humans think and how language interacts with perception, action, and memory. Rather than viewing language as an isolated system, my work emphasizes its embedded nature within a brain optimized for multiple functions. By combining behavioural methods, eye tracking, and cognitive neuroscience techniques (such as fMRI, TMS, and polysomnography), I explore the dynamic processes underlying language, learning, and memory across the lifespan.

# Selected Publications

My research is organized around several core themes. Below are representative publications grouped by topic.
