# Research background

I am interested in how humans "think". As it turns out, language is integral to "thinking". My research goal has been to understand the embedding of the language system in its broader context of a brain specialised for the goals of perception and action, rather than seeing language as an isolated modular system. This research has used behavioural measures, eye tracking and cognitive neuroscience methods, including fMRI, TMS and polysomnography. Publications arranged by topic are available
below.

# **Word learning, sleep and memory**

This work has concentrated on how adults learn new words. A key motivation is applying what we know about how learning and memory to understand how language learning works. And in turn, understanding the mechanisms involved in language learning can help inform models of memory. Some of this research was funded by an ERSC grant in colloboration with Gareth Gaskell and Scott Cairney.

# **Langugage, vision and event representation**

This research has investigated the interaction of visual processing in language comprehension, based on the idea that language comprehension is aided by the visual system in helping us understand events.

# **Speech perception and the motor system**

Contrary to some claims from embodied cognition, this research provides evidence against the idea that premotor component of the speech production system is involved in speech perception.
