# Research background

With a background in cognitive science, I am interested in how humans think. As it turns out (and philosophers have known for quite a while), language is integral to thinking. Previously, many took a modular approach to understanding the mind and how language works within it, with the idea that there are separate systems for language, thinking, memory, perception and action. However, my research goal has been to understand the embedding of the language system in its broader context of a brain specialised for the goals of perception and action, rather than seeing language as an isolated modular system. 

My research concerns the relationship of the language system with perception, action, sleep and memory. I have a specialisation in psycholinguistics and have conducted studies of language learning, sub-lexical processing, lexical processing and semantics, and discourse level processing. 
While psycholinguistics has been a focus in my research, understanding how language permeates across the brain naturally leads to investigating other areas. This research has used behavioural measures, eye tracking and cognitive neuroscience methods, including fMRI, TMS and polysomnography.

# Word learning
This work has concentrated how adults learn new words. 

Some of this research was funded by ERSC grant in calloboration with Gareth Gaskell.

# Speech perception and the motor system 

While some of research has looked at the invovlement of motor and perceptual systems in language processin, contrary to some claims from embodied cognition, this research provides evidence against the idea that premotor component of the speech production system is involved in speech perception.

# Meditation
I have an interest in Zen and Vipassana meditation, which led to this paper on what might be happening in the brain in certain meditative states.
