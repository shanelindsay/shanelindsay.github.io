### Exemplar based peer assessment
Increasing capability in assessment and self-regulation through multiple choice marking of exemplars

With [Stuart McGugan](http://www2.hull.ac.uk/administration/leap/whos-who-2/s_mcgugan.aspx) and [Ellie Hemmingway](http://www.elliehemingway.co.uk/), I am working on a project to develop student understanding of assessment. This research has been supported by a Pedagogic Development Grant from the University of Hull.

This work is ongoing and has been presented at New Directions in STEM 2016.

There is a growing body of evidence which indicates that the potential learning benefits of providing students with feedback, however well crafted, are often not realised, with many students not valuing or understanding the feedback provided (Nicol, 2010). Sadler (2010) has argued that for students to benefit from feedback they must first possess the ability to make a comparison between their own performance and an expected standard. However, as Oâ€™Donovan et al. (2004) have found, statements of assessment standards often fail to provide both students and staff with the effective transfer of both explicit and tacit assessment knowledge. To address this concern it has been argued that as well as focusing on the quality of feedback messages, teachers in higher education should focus their efforts on strengthening skills of self-assessment amongst their students, which is helped by exposure to a range of exemplars (Sadler, 2010).
