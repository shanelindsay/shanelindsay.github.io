My teaching approach


## Projects
### Exemplar based peer assessment
 Increasing capability in assessment and self-regulation through multiple choice marking of exemplars

With [Stuart McGugan](http://www2.hull.ac.uk/administration/leap/whos-who-2/s_mcgugan.aspx) and [Ellie Hemmingway](http://www.elliehemingway.co.uk/), I am working on a project to develop student understanding of assessment. This research has been supported by a Pedagogic Development Grant from the University of Hull.

This work is ongoing and has been presented at New Directions in STEM 2016.
