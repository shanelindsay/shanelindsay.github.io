# Academic website revamp

Purpose: redesign the Jekyll site with a stronger visual identity and refreshed content structure.

## Quick start

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Review (January 2026)

### Strengths
- Clear separation of research, teaching, and lab content.
- Solid publication list and external profile links.
- Jekyll + GitHub Pages setup is lightweight and easy to deploy.

### Gaps
- Visual design relies on the default Minima theme with minimal branding.
- Navigation and landing page feel text-heavy and dated.
- Content hierarchy lacks clear calls-to-action for students/collaborators.
- Blog listings are utilitarian and do not surface recent highlights.

### Revamp goals
- Establish a distinctive visual identity (typography, colour, layout).
- Create a structured hero section with key links and CTAs.
- Use consistent page headers and richer layouts across sections.
- Ensure responsive layout and accessibility basics.
