I run the **CogLang** - _the **Cog**nition and **Lang**uage Laboratory_. See the [research](/research) page for more information on research in the lab. 

## Kit and tools
We use a variety a methods in the lab to understand cognition, depending on the questions involved. Two main methods are behavioural techniques (such as measuring reaction time) and tracking visual attention with an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker. We also have access to methods from cognitive neuroscience which include EEG, TMS and tDCS.

If you are an undergraduate who would like to join us and find out more about research, please contact me to apply. For students interested in working in the lab with me as a third year project supervisor, feel free to drop by or email to discuss any ideas for projects.
